# Johan's Wireless Corne Keyboard Layout

A [ZMK](https://zmk.dev/)-powered layout for a wireless 6-column Corne keyboard with
[nice!view displays](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-view/), optimized for macOS with
a focus on programming, design work, CAD and Swedish language support. Inspired by
Callum Oakley's approach to modifiers.

## Layout Overview

- Base layer: Colemak
- Dedicated Swedish characters (å, ä, ö)
- No home row mods, for improved typing consistency
- Additional layers:
  - Symbols layer
  - Navigation layer
  - Numbers layer
  - Gaming layer (toggle-able)

## Design Philosophy

This layout prioritizes:

- Clean, predictable modifier behavior without timing-dependent mod-taps
- Efficient access to programming symbols
- Left-hand-only access to keys and modifiers needed for navigation in design software (Affinity, Adobe) and CAD software (Autodesk Fusion)
- Seamless Swedish/English typing
